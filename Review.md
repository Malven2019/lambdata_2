Code review:

The code is very well formatted and easy to read.  The logic is clear enough so that any future contributor would be able to understand the code and use it and/or build on it. The only suggestion I would make is to add a little more spacing in the dataframe_helper, which is very minor. Also you have 2 setup files, and only need one in your base directory, however the code is very well laid out in those files as well.

Score: 2
